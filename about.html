		<p>We always knew there had to be a better way to buy used cars. One that would make the process easy and fun.</p>
		<p>So we created The Car Company, and we've been changing the way America buys cars since we opened our first store in 1998.</p>
		<ul>	
			<li>&#8728; Offer tens of thousands of used cars across the country</li>
			<li>&#8728; Sell every car with a low, no-haggle price</li>
			<li>&#8728; Provide only vehicles of superior quality that meet our high standards</li>
			<li>&#8728; Buy cars from customers, whether they buy from us or not</li>
			<li>&#8728; Deliver friendly, one-of-a-kind customer service</li>
			<li>&#8728; Through hard work and dedication, we've grown from that one store to more than 100 stores across the country.
			<li>&#8728; We’ve sold more than 5 million cars. We've appraised more than 20 million.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The Car Company was built on the fundamental principle of integrity, reflected in the way we serve our customers,</p>
		<p>treat each other, and deliver our products.</p>
